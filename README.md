# python-challenge-1
#As I am new to coding and finding the learning curve steept, I referenced a number of sources in the completion of this challenge.  These sources are as follow:

#1. A tutoring session through the EdEx platform with Paddington; This tutor helped me read through the code, understand what was being asked and in some cases where to find the necessary code and information - either from telling me some code snippets to use or referring directly to the activities from the Module 2 classwork.  In some cases, I copy-and-pasted form this coursework.

#2. I Googled terminoology to understand the function of different code elements and snippets.

#3. I used ChatGPT as a reference to understand code snippets, blocks of code, syntax and to understand what code to use when I got stuck.  I passed my code through ChatGPT for syntax editing as I was having difficulty with spacing, tabs, brackets, etc.  I also copy-and-pasted some parts of the ChatGPT code into my challenge when I wasn't able to make it work properly.

#To the best of my recollection, the above - in addition to references to class notes and coursework materials - are the resrouces that I used in completing this challenge.
